    <p>I am Manisha Hierd√© and am currently a final year student in Food & Process Technology at the Hague University of Applied Sciences. I am very passionate about creating a more sustainable world and am eager to apply my knowledge to improve green production in the industry. This way I aim to make a positive impact on society. 
    </p> To help me create an impact I take on many challenges and am always finding new things to learn. I write regularly on what fascinates and interests me. Currently the focus lies on my graduation internship at TNO, where I learn all about electrochemistry.
