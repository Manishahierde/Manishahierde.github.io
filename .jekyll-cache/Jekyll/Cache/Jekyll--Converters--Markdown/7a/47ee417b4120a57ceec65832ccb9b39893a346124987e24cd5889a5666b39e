Currently I am in the final phase of my Process &amp; Food Technology studies. During my studies I have focused on several areas from the basics such as Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena to more advanced subjects such as Process Dynamics &amp; Control and Reaction Kinetics. Process design and process optimimalisation are the subjects which truly give me energy and which I would like to specialize in.</p>
