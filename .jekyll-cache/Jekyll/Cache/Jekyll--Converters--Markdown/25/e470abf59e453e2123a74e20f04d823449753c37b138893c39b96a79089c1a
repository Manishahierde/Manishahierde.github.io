Currently I am in the final phase of my Process &amp; Food Technology studies. During my studies I have focused on several areas from the basics such as Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena to more advanced subjects such as Process Dynamics &amp; Control and Reaction Kinetics. Process design and Process optimimalisation are the subjects which truly give me energy and which I would like to specialize in.</p>

<p>My last phase includes my internship at <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/">TNO</a> where I focus on a more sustainable synthesis pathway via  electrochemistry. Here I use cyclic voltammetry to obtain potential windows of reactants and to determine the reaction parameters for mediated electrochemical synthesis. Ultimately, I hope to gain experience in this field which can be applied in the production of hydrogen.</p>
